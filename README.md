# Improbable-Beef
* Overview


This project aims at analyzing data from many volunteers to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. These bacteria will help Improbable-Beef in manufacturing synthetic beef.

A HTML/JavaScript page that displays a customized dashboard with a bar chart that identifies the type of bacteria, a gauge that displays the number of times a belly button is washed per week and a bubble chart that shows the abundance of specific bacteria per sample. 
The page is interactive and the user is able to use a drop down list to choose a specific volunteer, the information on that volunteer is displayed in a table and the gauges and graphs will adjust to the results of that specific volunteer.

CSS has been used to add a background picture and a text to the HTML page.
